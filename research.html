      <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed. In electrical engineering, ML is revolutionizing how we predict load demand, detect faults, and optimize grid operations.

      <h2>Applications in Electrical Engineering</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Load Forecasting:</strong> Predicting future energy demand using historical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Fault Detection:</strong> Identifying anomalies in real-time to prevent outages.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Optimization:</strong> Enhancing efficiency in smart grids and renewable integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Maintenance:</strong> Anticipating equipment failures before they occur.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Common tools include Python, MATLAB, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn. These platforms support data preprocessing, model training, and deployment for real-world applications.
